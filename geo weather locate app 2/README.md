This is an client side web application with javascript integrated with forecast.io and google map,

easy to use : 

It's a demo that if you need to display your application ,your may need to change the api_key in the future.

just input your address and date of whenever you like ,
And it would return you the charts to show the daily and hourly temperature humidity  from forecast through hours and next week with chart.js

History log would show up when you input the location and date,and let you retrieve your query before.

Script version, code modularized, easy to be extended.

Have fun with that!
